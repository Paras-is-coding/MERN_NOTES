- web based app run in Client-Server model
 - client -> request creater (brower,mobile app, desktop app)
 - server -> responder (file server ,web server, smtp ,db)

-packages/modules/library/microframework  -> we use while making project

-monolith <- architecture mostly we use for project in nepal
-microservice -> architecture for project for big project




-MVC pattern -> organizing code(make flow of code) for s/w development

**view-> request(url/route) -> Controller(handle data from route(eg validate login))  -> model(connected with DB(eg check for login data in DB))

**middleware(between view and controller eg for checking if user is logged in already)
**service (between controller and model for calling model from controller)


--API(phase between request by client ,process by server and getting response)

-- in primary layer we use MVC pattern ,  in internal layer like controller,service we use singleton pattern
