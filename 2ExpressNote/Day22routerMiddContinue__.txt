- create routing middleware using express(ko Middleware object)

- instead of using app level middleware for routing use routing level middleware

- the router we made is different app. so we mount that to express app

- we can group midd. with similar routs but diff. req. methods 
 router.route(/egcategory) 
    .get()
    . _ _ _ 
- router.use() will always exe. but in hierarchy in which it appear
