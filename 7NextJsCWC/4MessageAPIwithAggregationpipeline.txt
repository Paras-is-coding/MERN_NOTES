Message api
    - POST(status update),GET(tell current status)
    - GET all messages(aggregation pipeline),POST(save message)
    - We'll use session to find out logged in user


aggregation 
    - In user, messages[] array of Document type so dumping full array is not that optimized
    - so, we'll use agg. pipeline
